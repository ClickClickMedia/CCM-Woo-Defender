### Objective

Create the first production-capable baseline of `CCM Woo Defender` to reduce WooCommerce transaction spam/fraud attempts without external services.

### Implemented

- Plugin bootstrap and WooCommerce dependency gate.
- HPOS compatibility declaration.
- Checkout-time fraud analysis and blocking pipeline.
- Persistent local event history and blocklist token store.
- Multi-signal fraud scoring (beyond basic rate limits).
- Order status feedback loop (`failed`/`cancelled`) to improve detection.
- WooCommerce admin screen with quick stats and secure reset action.
- Privacy-safe hashed token approach for IP/email/address/device/payment signatures.

### Why this approach

- Fraud pattern in provided screenshots is not strictly burst-rate; it is identity churn around stable order value/gateway.
- Scoring across correlated signals catches low-frequency, high-consistency abuse that bypasses simple throttles.
- Local-only design stays lightweight and avoids external dependencies.

### Planned next iteration ideas

- Add optional challenge mode for medium-risk requests.
- Add configurable signal weights in admin settings.
- Add audit export and per-gateway sensitivity profiles.
